# ITCI-ordinal-continuous

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

Various case studies with ordinal and/or continuous endpoints are
analyzed in this repo using the information-theoretic causal inference
(ITCI) framework.

This project relies on the `renv` package for managing R packages and
ensuring a reproducible environment. When opening this project in
RStudio, `renv` is automatically initialized and will suggest to
install/update packages. To ensure reproducibility, it is advised to
follow this suggestion.
